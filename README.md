# CASE STUDY

As the name suggests, the library management system project is
related to the storage of information regarding the library. Library is
the place with the huge collection of books. It is place from where the
students and the faculties issue the books for their reference
purposes. But the maintenance of keeping the records of issuing and
borrowing is difficult if you use a normal book as a registry. To make
this task easier, the library management system will be very useful. It
helps in maintaining the information regarding the issuing and
borrowing of books by the students and the faculties. The library
management system case study gives the case study of the library
management system.

The students and the faculty will be able to issue the books from the library.
There will be different limitations on the number of days that the books can
be renewed for. If the library management system is implemented it will help
the librarians in simplifying the work. In the case of libraries with huge
collection of books it will be difficult in locating the position of the book. It
will be helpful in simplifying the work at the library. The project can have the
following features:
Book id: This is a unique id through which the book can be tracked.
Borrower: It is the person who will borrow the book from the library.
Issuer: The person who issues the book like the librarian.
Date of issuing: It is the date that will be recorded on which the book will
be issued.
Date of return: It is the date on which the particular book will be returned.
Fine: Extra amount received for the late return of the book.
